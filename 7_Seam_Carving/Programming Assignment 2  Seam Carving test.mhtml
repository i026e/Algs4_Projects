</p><p><b>How do I manipulate images in Java?</b>
Use our <a href=3D"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Picture.java=
.html">Picture</a>
data type (which is part of <tt>stdlib.jar</tt>)
and the <a href=3D"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.=
html">Color</a>
data type (which is part of the java.awt library).
Here is some more information about the
<a href=3D"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/index.php#Color"=
>Color</a>
and
<a href=3D"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/index.php#Pictur=
e">Picture</a>
data types.
<a href=3D"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.h=
tml">Luminance.java</a>
and
<a href=3D"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Grayscale.java.h=
tml">Grayscale.java</a>
are example clients that use the <tt>Color</tt> and <tt>Picture</tt> data t=
ypes, respectively.


</p><p><b>I noticed that the Picture API has a method to change the origin =
(0, 0)
from the upper teft to the lower left. Can I assume (0, 0) is the upper lef=
t pixel?</b>
Yes.

</p><p><b>Must the arguments to <tt>removeHorizontalSeam()</tt> and <tt>rem=
oveVerticalSeam()</tt>
be minimum energy seams?</b>
No. These methods should work for any valid seam (and throw an exception fo=
r any invalid seam).

</p><p><b>Clients.</b>&nbsp;
You may use the following client programs to test and debug your code.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/Print=
Energy.java">PrintEnergy.java</a>
computes and prints a table of the energy of an image with filename provide=
d on the command line.=20

<p></p></li><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/ShowE=
nergy.java">ShowEnergy.java</a>
computes and draws the energy of an image with filename provided on the com=
mand line.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/ShowS=
eams.java">ShowSeams.java</a>
computes the horizontal seam, vertical seam, and energy of the image with f=
ilename
provided on the command line.=20
Draws the horizontal and vertical seams over the energy.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/Print=
Seams.java">PrintSeams.java</a>
computes the horizontal seam, vertical seam, and energy of the image with
filename provided on the command line.=20
Prints the horizontal and vertical seams as annotations to the energy.
Many of the small input files provided also=20
have a <tt>printseams.txt</tt> file=20
(such as <a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarv=
ing/5x6.printseams.txt">5x6.printseams.txt</a>), so you can=20
compare your results to the correct solution.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/Resiz=
eDemo.java">ResizeDemo.java</a>
uses your seam removal methods to resize the image.
The command line arguments are filename, <em>W</em> and <em>H</em> where
<em>W</em> is the number of columns and <em>H</em> is the number rows to=20
remove from the image specified.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving/SCUti=
lity.java">SCUtility.java</a>
is a utility program used by most of the above clients.



</li></ul>
<p><b>Sample input files.</b>
&nbsp;
The directory <a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/sea=
mCarving">seamCarving</a> contains
the client programs above along with some sample image files.
For convenience,
<a href=3D"http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seamCarving-testi=
ng.zip">seamCarving-test.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together.
You can also use your own image files for testing and entertainment.

</p><p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>

<p></p><li>Start by writing the constructor as well as <tt>picture()</tt>, =
<tt>width()</tt> and <tt>height()</tt>.
These should be very easy.=20

<p></p></li><li>From there, write <tt>energy()</tt>.
Calculating =CE=94<sub><em>x</em></sub><sup>2</sup> and =CE=94<sub><em>y</e=
m></sub><sup>2</sup>
are very similar. Using two private methods will keep your code simple.
To test that your code works,
use the client <tt>PrintEnergy</tt> described in the testing section above.

<p></p></li><li> To write <tt>findVerticalSeam()</tt>, you will want to fir=
st make=20
sure you understand the topologial sort algorithm for computing a shortest =
path in a DAG.
Do <em>not</em> create an <tt>EdgeWeightedDigraph</tt>. Instead construct a=
 2d=20
energy array using the <tt>energy()</tt> method that you have already writt=
en.
Your algorithm can traverse this matrix=20
treating some select entries as reachable from <tt>(x, y)</tt> to calculate=
 where the seam is located.=20
To test that your code works,
use the client <tt>PrintSeams</tt> described in the testing section above.


<p></p></li><li> To write <tt>findHorizontalSeam()</tt>,
transpose the image, call <tt>findVerticalSeam()</tt>,
and transpose it back.

<p></p></li><li>Now implement <tt>removeVerticalSeam()</tt>.=20
Typically, this method will be called with the output of <tt>findVerticalSe=
am()</tt>,
but be sure that they work for any seam.
To test that your code words, use the client <tt>ResizeDemo</tt> described =
in the testing section above.

<p></p></li><li> To write <tt>removeHorizontalSeam()</tt>, transpose the im=
age, call <tt>removeVerticalSeam()</tt>,
and transpose it back.


</li></ol>

</p><p>

</p><ol>

<p></p><li>
There is no need to create a new <tt>Picture</tt> object after removing a
seam=E2=80=94instead, just maintain the updated energy matrix.
That is, you can defer creating a <tt>Picture</tt> object until
required to do so because of a call to <tt>picture()</tt>.
Since <tt>Picture</tt> objects are relatively expensive, this will speed
things up.

<p></p></li><li>
Avoid recomputing the parts of the energy matrix that don't change.

<p></p></li><li>
Don't explicitly transpose the <tt>Picture</tt>. Instead transpose the ener=
gy matrix when needed.
Instead of transposing it back when you're done,
just keep track of whether the energy matrix is transposed.

<p></p></li><li>
Test whether it is faster to traverse the energy matrix in row-major order =
or column-major order.

<p></p><li>
Your <tt>energy()</tt> method implemented the dual gradient energy function=
.
Try out other energy functions.=20

<p></p></li><li> Implement an interactive object-removal feature: The user =
highlights an area of the
image, and that portion of the image is forced to zero energy.
Rows and columns are then successively removed until every pixel in
that zero-energy region has been removed.
